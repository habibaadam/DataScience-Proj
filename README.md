# DataScience-Proj

#This project is the culmination of all the Python-specific material we learned in the data science pre-tech curriculum.
#Two data sets—one for Spotify's top songs from 2017–2018 and the other for the best-selling phones from 2000–2022—are included in the research. 
#To construct straightforward analyses and graphics of the contents of these datasets, library functions from the matplotlib and pandas packages are used.
#We chose these datasets for our study because they provided broad information that was applicable to practically all of the world, not just one specific region.
#People all throughout the world purchase phones and products of various kinds, as well as music. 
#Despite not being in a problem-solution format, the datasets are valuable for analysis and coding. 
#Thank You for reading!
